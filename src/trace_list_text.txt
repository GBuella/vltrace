List of supported sets:
	* Help:
		- 'help', 'list'    This list.

	* Intercepting using both KProbes and TracePoints:
		- 'common'             All syscalls provided by the kernel using:
                                       - KProbes on syscalls' entry and
                                       - TracePoint (raw syscall sys_exit) on syscalls' exit
                                       This is the default option.

	* Intercepting using KProbe:
		- 'kp-kern-all'        All syscalls provided by kernel.
		- 'kp-fileio'          FileIO - any syscall related to file IO
		- 'kp-file'            SCs with path in args
		- 'kp-desc'            SCs with fdesd in args
		- 'kp-sc_glob:*'       Choose SCs by glob pattern, such as 'set*'
		- 'kp-sc_re:.*'        Choose SCs by re pattern, such as 'set.*'
		- 'kp-raw_glob:*'      Choose low-level funcs by glob pattern,
		                       such as 'raw_glob:ext4_*'
		- 'kp-raw_re:.*'       Choose low-level funcs by re pattern,
		                       such as 'raw_glob:ext4_*'
		- 'kp-XXXX'            Choose exact single SC by name,
		                       such as 'open'
		- 'kp-raw:XXXX'        Choose exact single low-level func by
		                       name, such as 'raw:ext4_mkdir'
